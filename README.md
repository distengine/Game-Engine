# Game-Engine
An OpenGL Game Engine made with SFML

This engine currently has:

-A base drawable class
-Shapea
--Cube
--Vector/Direction ( for normal visualization and ray casting )
-Aligned Bounding box
-GLSL system
-Terrain system with height maps ( not yet pushed )

TODO:

-Push the terrain system
-Finish implementing the ray picking system
-Add a Particle system
-Add a lighting system
-Finish the text system ( Currently only works in ortho projection )
-Generally flesh out the engine more and clean up a lot of code
-Remember to comment the rest of the code.
